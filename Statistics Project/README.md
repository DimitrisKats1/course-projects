# Statistical Modeling and Variable Selection on the `mtcars` Dataset

## Project Overview
This project involves an exploratory statistical analysis and application of regression modeling techniques using the widely recognized `mtcars` dataset in R. The primary objective is the construction of a linear regression model for predicting vehicle fuel efficiency, measured in miles per gallon (`mpg`).

## Dataset
The analysis utilizes the `mtcars` dataset, containing 32 observations and 11 key variables describing vehicle performance characteristics:

- **mpg**: Miles per gallon (dependent variable)
- **cyl**: Number of cylinders
- **disp**: Engine displacement (cubic inches)
- **hp**: Horsepower
- **drat**: Rear axle ratio
- **wt**: Weight (in 1000 lbs)
- **qsec**: Quarter-mile time (seconds)
- **vs**: Engine shape (0 = V-shaped, 1 = Straight)
- **am**: Transmission type (0 = automatic, 1 = manual)
- **gear**: Number of forward gears
- **carb**: Number of carburetors

## Methodology
The analytical approach of this project includes the following steps:

1. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:
   - Data visualization and correlation analysis to understand relationships among variables.
   - Assessment of variable distribution and identification of potential issues such as multicollinearity.

2. **Initial Model Development**:
   - Fitting a preliminary multiple linear regression model using all available explanatory variables.
   - Diagnostic checks including residual analysis, leverage points, influence measures (Cookâ€™s Distance), and Variance Inflation Factor (VIF) to detect multicollinearity.

3. **Variable Selection Procedures**:
   - **Forward Selection**: Incrementally adding predictors based on their statistical significance and contribution to the model.
   - **Backward Elimination**: Starting from a full model, removing variables that are least significant.
   - **Stepwise Selection**: Combining forward and backward selection methods to arrive at an optimal subset of explanatory variables.

4. **Model Refinement and Transformation**:
   - Applying polynomial transformations (such as quadratic terms) to predictors identified as important in previous selection steps.
   - Assessing improvement in model diagnostics and fit metrics after transformations.

## Tools and Libraries
- **Programming Language**: R
- **R Libraries Used**:
  - `olsrr`: For automated variable selection.
  - `car`: For regression diagnostics and multicollinearity detection.
  - `ggcorrplot`: For correlation matrix visualization.
  - `ggplot2`: For data visualization.
