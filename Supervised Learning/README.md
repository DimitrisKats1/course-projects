### Supervised Learning Project

This notebook demonstrates an end-to-end approach for solving a classification problem using supervised learning. Key steps include:

- **Data Loading and Exploration:**
  - Load the dataset.
  - Perform an initial exploration to understand the data distribution and key features.

- **Data Preprocessing:**
  - Clean and transform the data.
  - Handle missing values, scaling, and feature engineering using pipelines.

- **Model Building and Training:**
  - Split the dataset into training and validation sets.
  - Train and compare multiple classifiers (e.g., Random Forest, Logistic Regression, SVC) using metrics like F1 score.

- **Hyperparameter Tuning and Final Predictions:**
  - Use grid search for hyperparameter tuning.
  - Apply the best model to generate final predictions on the test set.
